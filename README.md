The dataset contains multiple related tables so you can practice a wide range of SQL operations including:

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- `JOINs` (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Subqueries
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
- Creating `VIEWS`
- Query optimization with `INDEXES`

The dataset has been created for **learning and practicing SQL** in a realistic business setting.
